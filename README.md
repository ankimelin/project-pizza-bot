# Pizza Bot

A simple pizzabot using my first JavaScript.

## The problem

Started with the basic JavaScript variables, functions and conditionals, then moved on to HTML and CSS. Last most difficult part was to connect HTML and JavaScript code and make the pizzabot do what I want, this took a lot of trial and error, googling and some Stack Overflow questions. The JavaScript was rewritten to suit how I wanted the user to interact with the pizzabot.
